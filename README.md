# QGIS-and-Python-2-
We reconstructed the national and provinical routes across Corrientes, one of Argentina's 24 provinces. We used the map services from the National Geographic Institute (https://www.ign.gob.ar).
Then we connected those routes and roads to the capital of each county. 
With QGIS tools and a python code provded, an Origin-Distance matrix was constructed wich calculated the costs of each journey, assuming 12 liters of gas are consumed per kilometer travelled and AR$90 as the price of gas.
The costs are measured in argentinian pesos per pixel. 

Both matrix and map are uploaded.
